Fledgling programmer with a decently long past of surface level experimentation, such as various small scale Scratch, Roblox, and GameMaker projects. 
Currently trying to learn C# for gamedev. Hoping to eventually move into an engine like Godot, GameMaker or Unity once I actually get this all nailed down.
